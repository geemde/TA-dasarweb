                <h3>Sr. Product Development Designer <br>at Mattel Asia Pacific</h3>
                <p>The contract was 3 months, and I regretted my decision that it lasted for 3 months only. I wish that time, Gilang not only as my intern, but he would choose to join my team as his next career path. Fast Learner is my 1st impression of him. Huge Eagerness to learn new thing, with or without "direct mentor". He is willing to jumped by himself to learn about everything, and to complete it, he knows what is "Team Work" and did it naturally. He gave many innovative ideas and you will have a good time with him on open discussion. Above all, we had a fun time working together.</p>

                <h3>Regional Head of IT & Innovation at ATALIAN Asia</h3>
                <p>I've led a handful of interns but only some leave the marks, and one of them is Gilang. Gilang has shown his credibility to understand the business process and aligning his assigned projects will full dedication without compromising the work quality. His thought process on documentations is beyond words and he managed to set a remarkable benchmark to the entire IT Team within the country & region. I would recommend Gilang and my door is always open for him, anytime.</p>
